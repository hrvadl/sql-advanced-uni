# Advanced SQL labs

This repository contains all labs I've done in "Advanced SQL" course.

## Lab #1

To run lab #1 make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/) installed. Then, run following command:

```go
make run-lab1 TASK=<n>
```

Where `n` is a number of task, varying from 1 to 10. For example:

```go
make run-lab1 TASK=7
```
